Notes for Live Session Week 3:
Authentication: Allows a user to create account and have info specific to them.
As the developer, you can set what type of data the users access and see.
Types:
Something you know
Most Common (password)
Something you are
Specific to who you are (biometric)
Something you have
(key card)
2 factor uses multiple of these types (BU uses this as KNOW and HAVE)
Categories quiz:
Password = know
Garage Door Opener = have
Fingerprint = are
My Key = have
Answer to question = know
OAUTH
Open-Standard authentication protocal
Federated Model = Federal level web security? (wrong)
Correction = Use of multiple other systems to perform verification process.
Example: Login will sometime ask if you want to use google, apple, ect.
Token-Based
Verify identity, then receive token
A series of bits that tells system that user is verified, like a key
Very encrypted
From 3rd party
Regenerated or Auto-renewed
OAUTH is based on the token based world
Session/Cookie Based
Verifies using session IDs stored as cookies
No 3rd parties, closed system
Most common model for simple sites
Clogs up memory banks
I have never built anything like this, but look forward to implement any of these as needed.
Authorizing is the act of Authentication
Specifies what data you're allowed to access and what your allowed to do
